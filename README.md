# üîê Google Auth Integration with .NET 8 & FastEndpoints

This project demonstrates how to implement Google OAuth 2.0 authentication using FastEndpoints in a clean, secure, and modular way.

---

## 1. üìå Title / Research Topic

**Integrating Google OAuth 2.0 with FastEndpoints in .NET 8**

A working demo that shows secure Google login flow with JWT generation using modern .NET technologies.

---

## 2. üéØ Purpose / Motivation

The goal was to simplify and demonstrate external login integration in a .NET REST API.  
FastEndpoints was chosen for its minimal boilerplate and performance-focused routing.

---

## 3. üîç Explored Areas / Subtopics

- Google OAuth 2.0 redirect & token exchange  
- FastEndpoints usage for endpoints/middleware  
- Cookie auth vs JWT auth  
- Securing `appsettings.json`  
- .NET Authentication pipeline configuration

---

## 4. üõ† Methodology / Approach

- Followed FastEndpoints & Microsoft docs  
- Referenced real-world blog examples  
- Performed OAuth redirect and callback testing  
- Manually set up Google Developer Console project  
- JWT tokens issued after successful login

---

## 6. üß™ Key Findings / Notes

- Google login requires `DefaultScheme = Cookie`, `DefaultChallengeScheme = Google`  
- Callback endpoint must match what is defined in Google Console  
- FastEndpoints integrates seamlessly with `UseAuthentication()` and `UseAuthorization()`  
- JWT is issued after the callback  
- Always `.gitignore` your `appsettings.json`
